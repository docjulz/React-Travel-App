        description: "Killer Dana was once considered as one of Southern California's premier point break surf spots. Situated along the coastal communities of Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente, it rose to popularity as a challenging break for a tight-knit group of surfers who relished the occasional massive rights and treacherous powerful waves that rose from deep water and broke onto the rocks that lined up the beach. Thus produced the Killer Dana namesake and reputation.",
